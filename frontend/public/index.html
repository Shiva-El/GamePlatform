<!-- This index.html file is a relatively empty file which only acts as a shell for the React app. 
      React just needs an entry point (defined via createRoot()) which will be used to attach the generated user interface to the displayed website.
       The HTML file and its content therefore do not directly define the website content. Instead, the file just serves as a starting point for the React application, 
       allowing React to then take over and control the actual user interface.
